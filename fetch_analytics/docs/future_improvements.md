# Future Improvements

## Data Quality Improvements

1. Receipt Validation
   - Address small receipt rejection pattern (2-3 items have 15x higher rejection rate)
   - Investigate high variance in per-item values ($3.81 - $6.69)
   - Develop consistent validation rules based on:
     * Item count (13.57 vs 2.33 average)
     * Total spend ($90.78 vs $8.89 average)
     * Per-item value thresholds

2. Volume Monitoring
   - Track monthly volume fluctuations (Dec: 30 vs Jan: 379)
   - Implement alerts for unexpected volume drops
   - Create daily/weekly trend analysis
   - Monitor receipt counts by:
     * Brand category
     * Item count
     * Total spend ranges

3. Brand Data Standardization
   - Standardize brand naming (e.g., consistent format for Ben & Jerry's)
   - Track brand performance metrics:
     * Items per transaction (Ben & Jerry's: 4.9, Annie's: 2.0)
     * Average transaction value (Ben & Jerry's: $66.81, Kleenex: $20.88)
     * Receipt acceptance rates by brand

## Analytics Enhancements

1. Performance Metrics
   - Track acceptance rates by:
     * Receipt size (items)
     * Total spend
     * Brand category
   - Monitor month-over-month brand performance
   - Analyze item count impact on acceptance

2. Brand Analytics
   - Track top performers:
     * Transaction count (Ben & Jerry's: 29)
     * Total spend (Ben & Jerry's: $1,937.39)
     * Items per receipt (Ben & Jerry's: 4.9)
   - Monitor brand consistency across months
   - Identify successful brand patterns

3. User Behavior Analysis
   - Analyze receipt size patterns
   - Track spending patterns by brand
   - Monitor rejection patterns
   - Identify successful submission characteristics

## System Optimizations

1. Data Processing
   - Optimize for varying receipt sizes (2-142 items)
   - Handle volume fluctuations (30-379 receipts/month)
   - Improve processing for:
     * Multi-item receipts (up to 13.57 items)
     * Small receipts (2-3 items)
     * High-value transactions ($90.78 average)

2. Performance Monitoring
   - Track processing times
   - Monitor acceptance rates
   - Alert on pattern changes:
     * Rejection rates
     * Volume fluctuations
     * Brand performance
