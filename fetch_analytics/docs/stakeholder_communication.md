# Data Quality and Analysis Findings

Dear Product Team,

I've completed a comprehensive analysis of our receipt data and would like to share key findings and recommendations.

## Key Findings

1. Data Quality
   - We found inconsistencies in date formatting and sequences
   - Some receipts have price discrepancies (final price > item price)
   - Missing brand information in approximately 15% of items
   - Inconsistent status progression in receipt processing

2. Business Insights
   - Average spend is higher in accepted receipts vs rejected ones
   - We've identified the top performing brands
   - Recent users show different brand preferences compared to overall user base

## Recommendations

1. Data Collection Improvements
   - Implement strict validation for price and quantity fields
   - Standardize date formats across all touchpoints
   - Add mandatory brand mapping for all products

2. Process Improvements
   - Add automated validation for receipt status progression
   - Implement real-time data quality monitoring
   - Create automated alerts for unusual patterns

## Questions for Discussion

1. Data Volume and Scale
   - What is the expected growth in receipt processing volume?
   - Are there seasonal patterns we should plan for?

2. Business Requirements
   - What are the SLAs for receipt processing?
   - Are there specific brands we should monitor more closely?

3. Technical Requirements
   - What are the performance requirements for query response times?
   - Do we need real-time reporting capabilities?

Would you be available for a meeting to discuss these findings and next steps?

Best regards,
Fahad
