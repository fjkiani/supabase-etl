Subject: Receipt Processing Analysis Findings & Questions

Dear Product Team,

I've completed an analysis of our receipt data and would like to share key findings and questions that need your input.

## Key Findings

1. Receipt Processing Patterns
   - High acceptance rate: 78.5% of receipts are approved
   - Accepted receipts average 13.57 items and $90.78 spend
   - Rejected receipts average 2.33 items and $8.89 spend
   - Strong correlation between receipt size and acceptance

2. Brand Performance
   - January 2021 shows significant activity (379 receipts)
   - Top performing brand: BEN AND JERRYS ICE CREAM
     * 29 transactions
     * 142 items
     * $1,937.39 total spend
     * $66.81 per transaction
   - Consistent performance from brands like KNORR SIDES across months

3. Data Quality Concerns
   - Small receipts (2-3 items) have disproportionate rejection rates
   - Large variance in per-item values ($3.81 - $6.69)
   - Significant volume fluctuation between months (Dec: 30 vs Jan: 379 receipts)

## Questions for Discussion

1. Receipt Validation Rules
   - Is the high rejection rate for small receipts (2-3 items) intentional?
   - Should we set minimum transaction values given the $8.89 vs $90.78 pattern?
   - Are certain product categories prioritized for validation?

2. Volume Patterns
   - Is the January volume (379 receipts) more representative of expected traffic?
   - What caused the December volume drop (30 receipts)?
   - What are typical monthly volume expectations?

3. Brand Performance
   - Should we investigate why frozen products (Ben & Jerry's) perform so well?
   - Are the brand-level spending patterns ($66.81 vs $20.88 per transaction) aligned with expectations?
   - How should we handle unmapped brand categories?

Would you be available to discuss these findings and questions? Understanding your perspective would help us prioritize improvements to the receipt processing system.

Best regards,
Fahad
